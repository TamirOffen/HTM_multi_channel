# HTM model for anomaly detection on SWaT dataset

Extra features derived from combinations of continuous channel values in L1. Each combination is another feature that will go into L2.
Encode a combination using TSSE, without performing permutations (step 2).
For example, we can take a look at combinations within each stage (P1,...P6). Or combination between all sensors.
